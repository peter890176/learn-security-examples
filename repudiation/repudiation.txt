- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
1.
Vulnerability:
The absence of authorization allows anyone to retrieve messages, and the user input is not sanitized. 
The secure version is better because it adds an authentication requirement and uses logs to trace the user's IP, which means it's more accountable

2.
To address the threat of repudiation, one method is to implement logging to record all usersâ€™ information and behavior. 
By doing this, audit policies can be realized based on the log record.

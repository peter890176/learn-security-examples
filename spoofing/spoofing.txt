Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
1.
The spoofing vulnerability includes scenarios where the username is not a string and the cookie is not set to HttpOnly. 
Ensuring the username is a string can prevent malicious users from injecting executable code through input, which could be a malicious process. 
Setting cookies to "HttpOnly" can prevent JavaScript from accessing the cookie, enhancing security.

2.
Only confidentiality is reduced. Malicious users can use the cookies to access web pages that should be protected for confidentiality. 
However, integrity and availability are not affected. 
This is because the integrity of the data remains intact, as authorized users' access does not alter the data's completeness.
The availability also remains unchanged, allowing legit users to access the web page normally.
